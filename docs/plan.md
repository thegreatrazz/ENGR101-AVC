# Team Agreement

By signing below, all team members are acknowledging that they have read and committed to their part in the AVC. They acknowledge that they will attempt to complete the tasks agreed on by the group each week and document this on the team github account. They acknowledge that failure to meet these goals can result in the team recommending any member receives a lesser grade for their AVC report.

In the event that a team member is unable to complete their task due to circumstances beyond their control (i.e. sickness, bereavement etc) that they will inform the team at the earliest possible time. Finally, the team acknowledges that a member going a week without contact with other team members (except when discussed with the team in advance) will constitute the member in question being considered *absent without leave*. In this instance the team agrees to inform the ENGR101 course co-ordinator immediately. The penalty this for this can range from a reduction in the final grade to immediate failure of the AVC (and thus the ENGR101 course). Should the team unanimously agree that a member (or members) have failed to contribute to the AVC sufficiently for other reasons, on the day of robot testing the team will be given the opportunity to anonymously vote for a team member to receive 0% for the robot part of the AVC. Should the team choose this option they MUST be able to show that the member in question had been assigned tasks that they failed to complete and that the team had afforded them an opportunity to make up for past mistakes.
